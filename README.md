Operating Room Surgery Times
============================

Use different machine learning methods to forecast the duration of a surgical
intervenction. Different models, e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Regressor,
etc., are trained using a Cross Validation Grid Search method with the aim of
finding the best set of parameters.

Once a good set of parameters is found for each of the regressors, a Voting
Regressor is setup to come up with the best possible predictive model.
